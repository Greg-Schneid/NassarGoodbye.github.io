<p> Hey Nassar, it has been a great term in MTE 121 having been taught by you. I want to thank you for all your efforts that went towards teaching us C++ and RobotC in our 1A term and often going out of your way to ensure that we had sufficient practice and understanding before heading into assignments and examinations. Although it is unfortunate that we will not have you for future courses, I know I speak for a few past upper year friends who are grateful for you efforts in those courses, I still thank you for helping to guide students in those courses as well. I wish you all the best in your future endeavours.</p>

<p> Nassar, I wish every other prof could put in even half the effort that you do in terms of helping us succeed in our studies. Never have I had a teacher who has had your dedication to help students!

I'll certainly miss having you as my professor, but honestly it's great that you're going to be at Tesla. I'm sure you will do great things for them. Best of luck!</p>
