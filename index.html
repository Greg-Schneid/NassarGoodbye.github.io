<p> Hey Nassar, it has been a great term in MTE 121 having been taught by you. I want to thank you for all your efforts that went towards teaching us C++ and RobotC in our 1A term and often going out of your way to ensure that we had sufficient practice and understanding before heading into assignments and examinations. Although it is unfortunate that we will not have you for future courses, I know I speak for a few past upper year friends who are grateful for you efforts in those courses, I still thank you for helping to guide students in those courses as well. I wish you all the best in your future endeavours.</p>

<p> Nassar, I wish every other prof could put in even half the effort that you do in terms of helping us succeed in our studies. Never have I had a teacher who has had your dedication to help students!

<p> دكتور نصار، مش عارف ابدأ منين بس فعلا مفيش حصة حضرتها اللا و استفدت، و دا نادر انه يحصل. حضرتك كنت بجد افضل مدرس و اخ لينا و اديت للسنة طعم تاني، مش عارف حنعمل ايه فالسيركتس، ربنا يستر، لكن بجد خسارة كبيرة للجامعة ان حضرتك ماشي و خسارة كبيرة لينا و طبعا للي داخلين السنين اللي جاية انهم مش حيعدوا بمدرس زي حضرتك. كنت اتمني حضرتك تقعد معانا حتي لو مش حتدرسلنا بس يكون حد زييك موجود لما نحتاجله و موجود يزود قيمة الجامعة اللي حنتخرج منها لكن انشاء الله بالتوفيق لحضرتك فالشغل الجديد و فأي حاجة تروحها يارب و نفضل علي اتصال دايما و نتقابل قريب انشاء الله. حابقي اعدي علي حضرتك فكالي انشاء الله.
سينسيرلي،
ياسين سمير</p>

<p> Assalamualaikum Nassar

Thank you for being the coolest prof we've ever had. Your help sessions carried, especially the part where you'd tell us stories about your 100% legal escapades in Egypt. You'll always be a legend, and I look forward to hearing about whatever crazy stuff you cook up at Tesla. 

PS Try not to drive your Cybertruck into the dealership ;-)</p>
